###Front End Coding Challenge 

Thank you for your interest in a front end development position 
at Advizr!  We like to get a sense for our candidates capabilities
by asking them to complete a code challenge for us.  This allows
you to show off your capabilities as a client-facing developer,
and we gain insight into how you complete common tasks you will
face as a member of the Advizr team.
 
####The challenge
 
This challenge should be able to be completed in 1-3 hours, but
we'll give you as much time as you need to complete it. At the
end of this page, you'll see a section marked **[Resources](#resources)**
that contains the endpoint and any other additional resources we
think might help you get this project done.

This challenge consists of three parts:
 
1. Interfacing with a REST API.
1. Manipulating data received from a server
1. Building a view for your data
 
By doing these three things, we will be able to determine your 
fit with the Advizr team by evaluating code completeness and the
functionality of the code produced.  We will be providing
a set of endpoints on a hosted server that you can call to 
receive a list of advisors similar to that used in the
administration section of our live website.

You'll take this data to build a view, and then allow the user
to delete one of the advisors by calling the same endpoint
with the `DELETE` verb.
 
####Extra credit
 
We always love seeing what candidates can do! If you're a CSS
ninja, please show us! Adding any additional features you think
would help demonstrate your abilities, please feel free.  In
particular, these areas are of interest to us:
 
 **Design chops**
   
   If you've got the ability to make this page attractive to
   end users and can do it in CSS, SASS or LESS, we'd love to see it.
 
 **Framework comfortability**
  
   This is a small enough project that you don't have to include
   a front end framework, but if you feel it's easier for you then please do so!
 
 **Code Patterns**
   
   This project could conceivably be done in a single view file
   and a single JavaScript file.  If that's what works best for you,
   great!
   
   However, if you're familiar with how to break up your view or
   Javascript into smaller reusable parts, we'd be interested
   to see that as well.
   
 **Code Review**
 
   We know that most projects we receive won't be perfect - in
   fact most projects we produce aren't either.  If you think
   there are any parts of this project which might experience
   potential pitfalls down the line, please let us know in a
   brief summary either attached to your project or sent with
   it in an email.
